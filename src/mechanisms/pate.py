    PATE (Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles) mechanism for differential privacy.
    This is a pared down version of the original PATE mechanism, focussing on the private prediction setting.
    It uses the PATE framework to aggregate predictions from multiple teacher models to produce a private prediction.
    There is no student model, since we want to just produce DP predictions from the teacher models.
